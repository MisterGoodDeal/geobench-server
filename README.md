# geobench-server
NodeJS API server for the react-native Geobench app

**Don't forget to create a `.env` file on the root directory otherwise the server can't run! You can use the `.env.template` for reference**

## Available commands
* `npm run start:dev` Allow to start the server locally with automatic refresh on file change
* `npm run start` Allow to build and start the server for the production environment 
* `npm run build` Allow to remove the previous build and re-create a fresh one
